git clone https://github.com/your-username/nex-runner.git
```
2. Open the Project Folder: Navigate to the project folder using the terminal:

```
cd nex-runner
```
3. Install Dependencies (if applicable): If your project uses npm or another package manager, run:

4. Open in Browser: Since it's a simple HTML5 game, you can open index.html directly in any browser:

 - Alternatively, you can start a local server if you need server-side support (use Python, Node.js, or similar tools).

## Alternative: Running with a Local Server
If you'd like to set up a local development server, you can use tools like http-server (Node.js), Pythonâ€™s SimpleHTTPServer, or any similar local server tool.

For example, with Python:
```
python -m http.server
```
Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to play.
